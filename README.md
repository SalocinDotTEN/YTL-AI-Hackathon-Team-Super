This is the front end portion of the team "Supar" project A.I. Tinkerers KL hackathon October 2024.

It is an attempt to resolve the [second problem statement](https://github.com/bleong-ytlailabs/ai-tinkerer-kl-four-hackathon/) of comparing documents and analysing the impact of the changes made to the documents.

This is the front end part that connects via API to the backend part of the project which is done via n8n.

Many thanks to Joseph Chin for the guidance and support in this project.

The project is done by the following team members:
1. Swaroop
2. Joe
3. Salocin.TEN
